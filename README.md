# Katanga iOS app

## Setting up the development environment
First install Ruby gems for Cocoa Pods:

```shell
	gem install cocoapods --version 1.1.1
```

Then go to project folder, and install Pods:

```shell
	pod install
```
If this doesn't work execute:

```shell
	pod repo update
	pod install
```
Last, open *.xcworkspace* on XCode IDE to complete the setup of the project.
